### by Melvin Gruschow, Copywrite May 17th, 2017

### Description
This is a .NET based web application utilizing SQL server as well as the Github API.  This project was created for Epicodus week 20 friday project

### Installation
* Download repo
* Open a powershell window and enter the following commands
  - dotnet restore
  - cd src/GitPortfolio
  - dotnet ef migrations add {whatever you want}
  - dotnet ef database update

I wanted to step up my style game a bit, so I went with a super minimal design and added a cool mouse over function, see if you can find it!!
